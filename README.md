Usage
=====

To generate a [directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph) with 4 vertices, 9 edges, and a minimum indegree of 2 for each vertex:

```
python3 graphgen.py --vertices=4 --edges=9 --indegree=2
```


Output
======

The program currently writes the output in the form of an [adjacency matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix) to standard output.
